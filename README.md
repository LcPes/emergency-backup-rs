Before installing, ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and `cargo` installed on your macOS
system.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Install Emergency Backup RS

1. Clone the repository and build the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emergency-backup-rs.git
   cd emergency-backup-rs
   cargo bundle
   ```
2. Move the built application to the `~/Applications` folder:
   ```bash
   mv target/release/emergency-backup-rs.app ~/Applications/
   ```

Alternatively, you can package the application and move it to `~/Applications` if required for distribution.

## Usage

1. **Connect your external drive**.

    - Navigate to `~/Applications` and open **Emergency Backup RS**.
3. **Configure the external drive** through the GUI interface.
4. **Select up to 5 directories** using the graphical interface.
5. **Draw a rectangle in a clockwise sense** on your screen to trigger the backup process.

The tool will copy the files to the selected external drive and notify you when the process is complete.

## Configuration

The configuration process is handled through a simple GUI. Upon running the application, you'll be prompted to:

- Select the external drive where backups will be stored.
- Choose up to 5 directories from your system for backup.

Once configured, the settings are saved for future backups. You can update them anytime by reopening the application.

## Examples

To get started quickly, just launch the **Emergency Backup RS** app from `~/Applications`, configure your drive and
directories, and draw the rectangle on your screen in a clockwise sense to start the backup.
